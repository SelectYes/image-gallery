# Image Gallery React App

A react app utilising the Unsplash Image API.


## About the Build

Besides the pretty photos, I found the Unsplash API’s extensive documentation and support a great resource for this project. The idea was to fetch photos by selecting a specific topic and displaying the collection in a scrolling gallery/carousel. 

The tools I used for this were React, HTML, SCSS and the amazing Slick JS library to build the carousel. 
 
### Functionality

You are presented with a menu bar with a list of predefined topics (grabbed from the API). Clicking on a topic fetches a collection of relevant pictures. 
You can then scroll through the collection by either clicking on the scroll-arrows or using the right and left arrow keys on your keyboard (This was to mimic the idea of using a remote control for a SmartTV app).
Once you start scrolling, the menu-bar will be switched to inactive and slide off the screen, and the gallery will stretch to take up the whole screen.
 
### Areas of development
* Having finished this project, here are some key areas I feel I’ve developed in:
* Making API calls and manipulating response data.
* Components, passing state and props. 
* Working within the limits of a library and tweaking it to fit your needs for your project. 
* Working with CSS modules to ensure there are no duplicate class names in the styling sheets.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
